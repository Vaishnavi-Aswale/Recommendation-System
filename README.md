__Content-Based__ or __Item-Item recommendation systems__. This technique attempts to figure out what a user's favourite aspects of an item is, and then recommends items that present those aspects.

__Collaborative Filtering__, which is also known as __User-User Filtering__ this technique uses other users to recommend items to the input user. It attempts to find users that have similar preferences and opinions as the input and then recommends items that they have liked to the input.
